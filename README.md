# ui-blocks

# Problem Statement

Do all developers in ServiceNow need to be UI developers to build seismic apps? Not really. Then why do we expect them to start learning HTML and CSS to build UIs ?

# How it works?

1. Import UI Building Block package
2. Import Blocks you need in you file.
3. Write your code inside the block and system will apply necessary styles for you.

# Example: Easily Create Layouts

## UI Looks like

## Code looks like

# Benefits

1. Faster component development
2. Every ServiceNow developer can build UIs as only expertise needed will be Javascript.
3. Building Components will be FUN and not a pain.
4. More control on the generated UI/components as the styling will be controlled centrally and hence all ServiceNow widgets will look consistent.
5. There will be a full blown list of UI Blocks which cater to all styling needs of developers.
6. Each UI block will have certain properties which can be configured only if need be.
